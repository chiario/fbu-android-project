Overview

Description

Help people find and sign up for volunteering opportunities near them.   Maybe scrape a few volunteering services or find some APIs in order to get the event information.

App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]

* *Category:* Lifestyle
* *Mobile:* Use location to find nearby events, maybe integrate with calendar to find free time
* *Story: *People often want to volunteer in their free time, but itâ€™s a lot of work to look for volunteering events.  This app would make it a lot easier for users to find volunteering opportunities, making it more likely that they will volunteer.  The app could also make it easier to see if any friends are volunteering at events near you  
* *Market: *Large market of high school kids who have mandatory volunteering hours.  
* *Habit: *Regular volunteers would come back to the app when they are looking for more events
* *Scope:* An MVP could simply leverage existing APIs or scrape existing sites to find volunteer events and offer them to the user. Further development could include functionality to sign up for events from the app, see what friends have signed up, and integrate calendar functionality to find free time to volunteer.
